## Appium on real iOS devices
```
TESTING USING XCODE 8 (INCLUDING IOS 10) WITH XCUITEST
```
$ brew install libimobiledevice

```
TROUBLESHOOTING IDEAS
```
Make sure UI Automation is enabled on your device. Settings -> Developer -> Enable UI Automation






## Running Appium on Mac OS X
```
SYSTEM SETUP (IOS)
```
If you're on Xcode 7.x and up, Instruments Without Delay (IWD) does not work.
You can enable IWD (which will significantly speed up your tests) using this method
https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/advanced-concepts/iwd_xcode7.md

```
Authorizing iOS on the computer
```
You need to authorize use of the iOS Simulator.
$ npm install -g authorize-ios
$ sudo authorize-ios
If you are running Appium.app, you can authorize iOS through the GUI.
You need to do this every time you install a new version of Xcode.

```
TESTING USING XCODE 8 (INCLUDING IOS 10) WITH XCUITEST
```
In order to automate iOS devices with Xcode 8 (which includes all testing of iOS 10+), you need to install the Carthage dependency manager
$ brew install carthage

```
FILES GENERATED BY IOS TEST RUNS
```
ios测试产生的文件有时会很大 所在目录 可删除

## Troubleshooting Appium
```
IOS
```
If you’ve ever run Appium with sudo, you might need to sudo rm /tmp/instruments_sock and try again as not-sudo.

If you have custom elements in your app, they will not be automatable by UIAutomation (and therefore Appium) by default.
You need to set the accessibility status to 'enabled’ on them.
The way to do this in code is:[myCustomView setAccessibilityEnabled:YES];
